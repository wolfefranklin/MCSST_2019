These codes are the work of Franklin Wolfe. PhD student at Harvard University in the Earth and Planetary Sciences.

The directions below describe how to create profiles across multiple fault scarps imaged with digital elevation data in an area with geologic age constraints, and subsequently run a series of analyses to determine the slip rate of the faults in question. The data outputs will be Line and Point Feature Classes that can be uploaded into an ArcGIS program to visualize the spatial distribution of fault slip rates and strain. Numerous subsets of data can be analysed simultaneously if there is a desire to create separate output files (ex: different data collection methods, age constraints, data locations, etc.). The following codes have been modified from the work of Tim Stahl (University of Canterbury, Department of Geological Sciences) and Biljana Lukovic (GNS Science, GIS Specialist), with whom they were made in collaboration with. There are five steps: (1) Profile Selection in ArcGIS, (2) Profile Data Extraction in Python,  (3) Fault Component Selection in Excel, (4) Slip Statistics Calculation in Matlab, and (5) Profile Upload to ArcGIS in Python.
